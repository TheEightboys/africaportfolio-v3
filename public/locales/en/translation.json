      "overview": "The Agriculture and Food Security Forum addresses one of Africa's most critical development challenges and opportunities. Despite possessing over 60% of the world's uncultivated arable land, Africa continues to face persistent food insecurity and agricultural productivity issues. This forum serves as a dedicated platform to transform African agriculture from subsistence farming to a modern, productive, and sustainable system that can ensure food security for the continent's growing population while creating economic prosperity. The forum aligns with the African Union's Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) and focuses on promoting agricultural innovation, sustainable practices, value chain development, and investment in agribusiness.",
